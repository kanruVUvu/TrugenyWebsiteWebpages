Genes are passed on from a parent to the child. A child gets one set of genes from the father and one set from the mother. Genes control the way you look, the way your body works and genes are what makes you unique. Genes can also increase the risk in a family for developing certain diseases such as cancers, heart conditions amongst many others.Learning about your genes can help you better understand your risks and take actions for preventing diseases and leading a healthier life.
